Pre-requisites:
* A deck of playing cards.
* Some poker chips or similar tokens.
* 4 or more players.

Objective:
The objective of the game is to collect all chips on the table by playing the right cards.  The rules, however, are secretly by the rulemaster, and the rest of the players must figure out what the rules are.

Start:
1) Designate one player as the rulemaster.
2) The rulemaster secretly creates 3 rules that follows the guidelines (listed at the bottom).
3) Determine the order that the rest of the players play.
4) Draw 5 cards for each player.
5) Hand out 5 chips to each player.
6) The rulemaster must say the following rules:
  "Unless the rules say otherwise, assume that
  1)Face cards has a value of 10.
  2) Ace can either be 1 or 11.
  3) Jokers (if in the deck) has a value of 0.
  Otherwise, the rest of the rules are secret, and you have to figure them out yourself."

How to play:
1) All players put one chip in the middle of the table.
2) All players plays a card at the same time.
3) The rulemaster lets the players know who is winning (if there's a tie, the rulemaster must indicate who is tying).
4) In order, the players can raise their number of chips.
*  If this happens, the rest of the players must either
* 1) raise up to that player's pile,
* 2) go all in if the player no longer have enough chips, or
* 3) fold, forfeiting their turn and losing their opportunity to play their next card.
* Note: at least one player cannot fold.
5) Any player that hasn't folded then plays another card at the same time.
6) Rulemaster, going by the rules, declares a winner, and gives all the chips to the winner.
* If there are ties, the rulemaster will distribute the chips as evenly as possible. They can select where the bias goes.
7) All played cards are then discarded.
8) All players draw two cards, and a new round begins.
9) The player with all the chips wins, and becomes the new rulemaster.
10) The last set of rules are secretly communicated to the next rulemaster, and the new rulemaster adds one more new rule.
11) Finally, the new rulemaster collects all the cards and chips from the players and discard pile, reshuffles the deck, and hands out 3 cards and 5 chips, beginning a new session.

Rule guidelines:
The rules should determine the winner based on how everyone plays during that round.  The round is considered ended the moment the last card is played.  Additionally, the cumulative effect of all the rules must designate at least one winner.
* Ties are allowed, though they should be avoided as much as possible.
* Rules that let those who fold win are allowed, but that rule can only apply if more than one player folds.
* Players that go all in can win, but the rules cannot specify that they always win.
* Rules cannot allow players, who lost all their chips, regain more chips.
* Newer rules trump older ones.  The first rulemaster can determine the priority of the starting rules.

example of a starting rule-set:
* highest cumulative card values wins the pot.
* clubs gives ten extra points on top of the card's value.
* aces are valued as 1.
