Pre-requisites:
* A deck of playing cards.
* Some tokens, preferably poker chips.
* 4 or more players.

Objective:
The objective of the game is to collect all chips on the table by playing the right cards.  The rules, however, are held secret by the rulemaster, and the rest of the players must figure out what the rules are.

Start:
1) Designate one player as the rulemaster.
2) The rulemaster secretly creates 3 rules that follows the guidelines (listed at the bottom).
3) Draw 5 cards for each player.
4) Hand out 10 chips to each player.
5) The rulemaster must say the following rules:
  "Unless the rules say otherwise, assume that
  1) Face cards has a value of 10.
  2) Ace can either be 1 or 11.
  3) Jokers (if in the deck) has a value of 0.
  There are 3 secret rules, and you have to figure them out yourself."

How to play:
1) All players draws cards from the face-down pile until they each have 5 cards in their hand.
2) All players put one chip in the middle of the table.
3) All players plays a card at the same time.
4) The rulemaster lets the players know who is winning (if there's a tie, the rulemaster must indicate which players are tying).
5) Starting with the winning player (if a tie, the rulemaster can determine who goes first), the players can raise their number of chips.
*  If this happens, the rest of the players, in clockwise order, must either
* 1) match up to that player's pile,
* 2) raise beyond the player's pile,
* 3) go all in (this is required if the player no longer have enough chips to match the player's pile), or
* 4) fold, forfeiting the opportunity to play their next card.
* Note: everyone cannot fold.  At least one player must play their second card.
* Note: this round can go around as many times as the players desire.
6) Any players that hasn't folded plays another card at the same time.
7) Rulemaster, going by the rules, declares a winner, and gives all the on the table chips to the winner.
* If there are ties, the rulemaster will distribute the chips as evenly as possible. They select where the bias goes.
* If this is the first round of the first session, the rulemaster must reveal one rule of their choosing.  Through-out the game, this is the only rule that is revealed.
8) All played cards are then discarded.
9) Repeat step 1 to 8 until one player gets all the chips.  This player is considered the winner.
10) The first player to lose gets to be the new rulemaster.  If more than one player lost at the same time, the rulemaster can decide which loser gets to be the new rulemaster.
11) The last set of rules are secretly communicated to the next rulemaster, and the new rulemaster adds one more new rule (secret from the last rulemaster.
12) Finally, the new rulemaster collects all the cards and chips from the players and discard pile, reshuffles the deck, and hands out 5 cards and 10 chips to each player, beginning a new session.

Rule guidelines:
The rules should determine the winner based on how everyone plays during that round.  The round is considered ended the moment the last card is played.  Additionally, the cumulative effect of all the rules must designate at least one winner.
* Ties are allowed, though they should be avoided as much as possible.
* Rules that let those who fold win directly (vs from valuation) are allowed, but that rule can only apply if more than one player folds.
* Players that go all in can win, but the rules cannot specify that they always win.
* Rules cannot allow players, who lost all their chips, regain more chips.
* Newer rules trump older ones.  The first rulemaster can determine the priority of the starting rules.

example of a starting rule-set:
* highest cumulative card values wins the pot.
* clubs gives 10 extra points on top of the card's value.
* aces are valued as 1.

Or...
* Lowest cumulative card value (described below) wins the pot (It can be negative)
* Card values are subtracted from each other (First - Second)
* Pairs looses instantly
